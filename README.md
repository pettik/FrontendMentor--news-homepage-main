## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, I needed a good understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge.
